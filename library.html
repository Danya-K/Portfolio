            <p class="content">
                Library was the last assignment from the FED assignments and in it we needed to create a Library for books where the predifined library will already be created with 
                "mocki.io" website and will be displayed on the website itself, from this point we needed to make a function to be able to add book, the title, author, year, genre and 
                description. Apart from that we also needed to make the edit button so that when you click on it, it will show you the details of the book and you will be able to change them,
                then, we needed to make a delete button where the book can be deleted from the list and the button for description details, this button is accessible if you click on the title 
                of the book. After that we also needed to create a search bar that will be searching only by title and author of the book and filter that will be able to filter the book by book first 
                and last letter as well as the newest and oldest year. We also needed to make everything saved when reload the page or close the page but even though I've tried it doesn't 
                work for me but everything else except from that is working. I also asked the teacher about it and he said that it is already a good job and it is okay if this one doesn't work.
                In order to create everything from there I had to use a lot of different sources, like W3Schools, youtube videos on how to create search bars and filters and I also looked 
                at the tasks we already had from our previous assignments. Also, I should mention that in order to figure out how to make edit button I had to use ChatGPT since other sources didn't work.<br>
                This is the last and the hardest assignment from FED Assignments and is using quite complicated JavaScript which is why it belongs to Development Learing Outcome since 
                learning and knowing JavaScript is the most important part of the Outcome.
