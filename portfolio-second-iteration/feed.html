                In the first week I've created a Business Card for<br> myself. The design idea is taken from a movie<br> "American Psycho". I decided to make it in a<br> professional way because I love
                formal style and<br> thought it would be cool idea to make my Business<br> card that way. I also asked for feedback from<br> teachers and created two more iterations to relate<br> a little
                more to the movie. This assignment relates<br> to the 1 Outcome because I created a concept and<br> made design out of t using formal design principles<br> to show my professionalism 
                and using visual<br> design techniques creating a cube around to give a<br> 3d fealing and to focus all the attention on the<br> center text of the card. It relates to 3 Learning <br>Outcome
                because I've got feedback for it and made <br>two new versions  from it. This assignment also<br> relates to 5 Learning Outcome because it shows my<br> personal preferences in style. </p>

                Second Assignment in the first week was to create<br> two photos: one Professional looking and second one <br>Creative. For the Professional me and my team found<br> a spot outside
                 of university and made pictures with<br> the Dots background. For the Creative photo I<br> suggested to draw something on the desk with<br> markers and take a picture using the
                  drawing as a<br> background. I made a drawing with a nimb and wings<br> and I took an inspiration for that painting from <br>anime "Death Note", there was a scene where a <br>
                  character was standing with wings behind him which<br> I really liked. This assignment relates to 5 <br>Learning Outcome because it shows what I like in <br>the assignments I do.

            <p class="p-proof">
                After the first week we had to create a<br> Presentation for the Group work we made. We made<br> our presentation based on the Paper Prototype Game<br> we made. Besides my
                involvement in creating slides<br> for the Presentation I was also the one who was<br> presenting in front of teachers and other students.<br> This task relates to Learning 
                Outcome 5 because<br> in my previous Semester I wrote that presenting is<br> my main weakness because it is really hard for<br> me to present in front of a lot of people since
                I<br> tend to forget words and feel embarrassed when a<br> whole lot of people watching me. Since then I was<br> trying to be the presenter for each presentation we<br> had in order
                to become better in that field. It was<br> a nice opportunity for me to improve since there<br> were 2 classes from 2nd and 3rd Semester which the<br> most of people I've ever
                presented to. Even though<br> there were some hesitations when I was presenting,<br> I still think it was great improvement because I<br> feel much more confident now in 
                presenting in front<br> of many people.

                We started our group work wit creating Contract<br> Agreement with our newly formed group. Except<br> creating Problem/Solution Section inside of the<br> Contract I was the one
                to create a template with<br> different shades of green on the objects and I also<br> made that temporary Logo to fit the template of the<br> Contract. The template is made in
                green and<br> professional style because we were expecting with<br> the group to go with that style as our main later<br> on. This task we made relates to 4 Learning Outcome <br>
                because we used professional standard for Contracts<br> in order to create our own Contract report. Link to<br> the Contract:<a href="https://www.figma.com/file/adh7Ssm9Xuxl7x5Onbm0Yk/Untitled?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=hXUg8BijLVJOdgbC-1">Contract Agreement</a>.

                After we finished the Contract Agreement it was<br> time for us to work on the branding for our Group.<br> We went through a lot of different iterations.<br> Those, that you see
                on the picture are all my<br> variants, the biggest one at the bottom is the one<br> that we agreed as a group to use it as our Final<br> Logo for the company. At first i was
                trying to<br> combine S's in the design that can remind of<br> something (snakes), that is why we also went for<br> the green at the beginning, because we were<br> expecting to go
                green theme for our company to look<br> nature-friendly, securing and growing. But, after I<br> asked for feedback from other students to see what<br> they think about it I 
                figured that snakes aren't<br> the best allegory for the company that creates<br> websites since it reminds of something poisonous,<br> betraying or something related to
                medicine. That is<br> when we wanted to make something different. We <br>agreed with the group to try new approach and<br> combine our interests into new design and concept.<br>
                We found out that we are very different group with<br> very different interests. That's why, since we are<br> internationals and have different interests I've<br> tried to 
                make a Logo with planet but it went not so<br> well and, in the end, after we got feedback from<br> teacher that it takes too long for us to create a<br> Logo we agreed to
                stay with spiral-looking circle<br> from S's I made previously. But, I decided to<br> improve on it. After getting feedback from the<br> teacher saying that I should try 
                to make it look<br> like an infinite stairs that doesn't have start and<br> end  I combined colours as well as their shades in<br> such manner that it looks like an infinite
                loop.<br> The 3 S's at the bottom of the Logo stands for our<br> group name "Triple-S" and is made in futuristic <br>style that was one of the things that was common<br> for us
                that we all liked. The purple shade was an<br> idea from another student from my group, Danylo, he<br> showed me list of colours and their psychological<br> meaning where
                we chose the one that suits our team<br> the best, which is purple, because it is futuristic <br>and ambitious, just like we are. Also, I need to<br> mention that first
                iterations of Logos were made in<br> Figma but, after receiving feedback that I need to<br> use Professional tools I made the last one<br> completely in Adobe Illustrator.
                This Assignment<br> relates to these Learning Outcomes: LO1, because<br> I've created a concept in Figma and translated it<br> into a complete finished product in Adobe<br>
                Illustrator applying visual design techniques and<br> principles as well as using examples from Infinite<br> Stairs; LO3, because I had around 15 iterations<br> with
                different approaches and feedback as I<br> explained higher; LO4, because I applied methods<br> for colours from professional fields of psychology<br> not only for
                purple colour, but also for the shades,<br> the deeper the S goes, the darker it becomes<br> creating an infinite loop bottom to top. Here is<br> the link to all of

            <p class="p-proof">
                During one of the Lectures we had to split up in groups and create an idea for Brand. We got Food as our topic on brand. We started with brainstorming what and how we
                 can do it and then I've got an idea for creating an online shopping mall for shops. After we draw it and finalised I went in front of class to present for other 
                 students and teachers. Whilst I presented there was feedback regarding the idea I came up with. The idea was to make stores compete between each other since they 
                 would have the rating system for their products for customers to choose the best products from different shops, but, students noted that it would be unprofitable 
                 for stores to join and compete. Good note, the solution for it can be to start the app without big stores but smaller one, make them compete, make it so that people 
                 will start using our mobile app because of it comfortability for them, instead of going to the stores, saving a lot of time for them. Seeing all that big companies 
                 can risk of getting big competition from smaller stores once they start growing and, in doing so, our app will force bigger companies to join as well. This task 
                 relates to Learning Outcome 5, because I was presenting it in front of whole class and debating on the solution with students, which as I explained in previous 
                 assignment is a big achievement for me since I am not a fun of being a main attention of a crowd.

                As one of the Branding part for our group we agreed that I am going to make a poster for the group. At first I made the one with abstract figures with cubes background.
                 The figures are made to give a 3d feeling and are made in futuristic shape and colour. I made front version as white and back version as black since we have two 
                 versions of our Logo for dark theme and for light theme. The first feedback I got from teachers was that it didn't represent our group and what we are doing. After I 
                 added the text of HTML,CSS and JavaScript I received feedback saying that the poster is quite boring. After that, I decided to go for completely new one and made front
                  page of the poster as a human statue with our Logo on him as well as our core values and what we are doing as a team. The SSS you see on his glasses as well as the 
                  Logo putted into his body is made by me in Photoshop. Texts are done in Illustrator. This assignment relates to this Learning Outcomes: LO1, because I've created a

                After we created a low-fidelity Prototype for our group website and designated the layout and placement of objects on the website I created a mid-fidelity Prototype based on it.
                For the design choices I decided to stick to our group ideas to look futuristic and made the prototype in purple tones. I also kept up to website standards with fonts and made only 
                three main fonts for the entire prototype: one for Headlines, one for Navigation Bar and the last one for the Text Descriptions. On the main page I decided to put Poster I made because 
                it is a good way to represent futurism and our brand, in general. On the about us page I decided to make different font describing names to represent all of my colleagues individually.
                On the contact page I used AI to generate an image of a woman with a cup of tea to represent nice chatting wit our team. Here is the link to the AI service I used for it: DeepAI. This assignment

Here is the link for the design:<a href="https://www.figma.com/file/8EbAh3LeSYyMi6Gmy26S2a/Website-Portfolio-Sketch?type=design&node-id=168%3A207&mode=design&t=HNgYPHo6aHWAPG5x-1"> Group Mid-Fidelity Prototype</a>.

                In my future iterrations I promised to create a website for my Portfolio. To start, I decided to create a low-fidelity Prototype to understand how it will look like with
                placements and design, in general. I decided to make my Portfolio website in old TV style because it is a big nostalgia for me when I was watching old cartoons on an old back 
                at home, so, I decided that it would be nice to make my Portfolio in that style since it is also a very appealing style to me. I also asked for feedback on it and received a 
                very positive feedback saying that it is a huge improvement from the one that I had in Previous Semester, also, for the mobile version I removed 3d part as stated in feedback as 
                well as for the back-up version decided to use Wix, web service that I used for first Portfolio itteration. This prototype relates to LO1, because I created a design that is connected to 
                my childhood and to me as a person, it also relates because I created it while keeping in mind that it should be easy to navigate and be able to go to the main content of website in a 
                few clicks. It also relates to LO3, because I asked for feedback about it and changed the Mobile version accordingly. And the last Ouctome it relates to is LO5, because for my personal growth 
                as a website developer and designer I created a website portfolio prototype with design that is in line with my core values. Here is the link to feedback I got:<a href="https://fhict.instructure.com/courses/13771/external_tools/1067"> Personal Low-Fid Portfolio Design</a>.

                Once low-fidelity prototype was created it was time to create mid-fidelity prototype from it. For this stage I decided to stick to the low-fid design prototype and just visualise how it will look like 
                here. However, I added one more thing to it. I decided that I am going to make a scene on the main page myself as 3d models and put them on the main screen. This assignment relates to 
                LO1, for the same reason as for low-fidelity prototype, which is because keeping the design user-centered and is connected to my childhood. It also relates to LO5, because I decided to make 
                a 3d for it because I has 3d as one of my favourites hobbys and I would love to improve in it more and more and to become better in this sphere. Here is the link to the prototype:<a href="https://www.figma.com/file/SpwClBa3teiSjJ8pKZc7Av/Untitled?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=HNgYPHo6aHWAPG5x-1"> Personal Mid-Fid Portfolio Design</a>.

                When the design part was finished I started implementing the design I had in high-fidelity prototype (website). While creating I realised that I need to change a few things. 
                The first thing I changed was buttons, I moved the on and off button to the side because of the resolution of the picture of tv I had, as well as moved work and about buttons to 
                the center for more pleasing look. And, inside of work button I changed to only two links because I rememberd teacher told me once, that I shouldn't overwhelm navigation, so i decided 
                to simplify it. I also received feedback regarding the responsivness of the TV picture and how I can fix it by using "image border slicing", so, I did that and it made my website better looking. This assignment relates to LO1,
                because I simplified the website for better experience and changed positions of buttons for better exeprience as well. LO2, because it is a code that is uploaded on GitLab and is commented. LO3, because
                I received feedback on how to improve the responsivness and made it.

                but I wanted to know how those recordings are done in studios so I made a recording for it.

                After we were done with branding of our own team we had a Client Presentations for Project choice and, once, we choose a client we startedd making Concept Document. And we 
                began it with creating Survey. Inside of it I made 7 questions regarding functionality and content on our service we are going to provide. I spreaded the Survey among very few middle-aged 
                people I knew, because they are our Target Audience for the Project. We also received feedback on the Survey saying that we need to also ask about allergies of people as well as their gender and age which I implemented later on. 
                This task relates to LO3, because we got feedback and created second itteration from it. LO4, because in order to acieve our project goal we applied a methodological approach and 
                asked our potential users what they would like to on our product by making a research survey.Here is a link to the Survey:<a href="https://forms.gle/exVewCuaeNctbd9t5"> Survey</a>.

                Once we made Survey and spreaded it I decided to take a look at other Nutrition Plans on the web and tried to make a version for ourselves. The websites I used as an inspiration
                are: Website 1; Website 2. In general, I wanted to give website a look that will be suiting and easy to navigate through and interact for our target audience, which is middle-aged people. This 
                task relates to LO1, because I created a visual design concept for our website and used other websites as a standard. LO4, because I searched on the Internet for other simmilar websites to 
                create the best possible design. Here is the link to design itself:<a href="https://www.figma.com/file/Nv2aoMzsGZ2p8pHwbpCPJk/NUTRITION-PLAN-PROTOTYPE?type=design&mode=design&t=HNgYPHo6aHWAPG5x-1"> Project Low-Fid Prototype</a>.

                and play when I was a kid. Since for now we had only one lecture on how to work with Blender modeling I created this scene only without any textures or colors, because I've never
                really worked with them. Once we have more lectures on it i am planning to improve it and add textures with colors and lights. I also want to sculpt a model of a doll that will be 
                sitting in the corner of the table but I will need a lecture on sculping for it, just like for the textures. This part of my Portfolio relates to LO5, because I am describing my plans

                Once the research was finished and we had a Low-Fidelity version of our Prototype ready we started to create Mid-Fidelity version of it. Since I was the one to create a 
                Low-Fidelity version I was also the one responsible to create a Mid-Fidelity version. When making t I decided to stick with the design I made and made a functional and linked 
                Prototype. When creating the design I thought that it should be simple looking and easy to navigte through since our target audience are elderly people. Most of the functionalities I 
                added were taken from Research we made, ChatBot so that people will be able to ask questions regarding their Nutrition Plan, Workout Page, so that people who strive to become muscular
                can also know what workout to do. When I was done with the Prototype we meet with other team members and discussed how it is. When discussion was done we agreed the design looks to simple 
                and we should make something more interesting since it's one of the tasks from our client to experiment with it. Then we made a few other itterations for main page look and feel and 
                ended up choosing Danylos version of main page. Then we reassigned tasks on who will do which page and I was the one who made a design for Questions page and for the About page. This 
                assignment relates to Learning Outcome 1, because I created a concept of Low-Fidelity Prototype and translated it into an interactive Prototype using research we conducted. It also relates
                to LO3, because I made fully one Itteration and then also made another itteration for other design choice we made for Prototype. Here is the link to both Prototypes: <a href="https://www.figma.com/design/Nv2aoMzsGZ2p8pHwbpCPJk/NUTRITION-PLAN-PROTOTYPE?node-id=89-2&t=TUIRY19gKBWSJGmH-0">Group Mid-Fidelity Prototype</a>

                During one of lectures we were creating Coke can. We started by creating a can form using cylyndr and techniques we learned in previous lectures. After the shape was done we 
                began to put the texture on it and then correctly unwrapping it so it would perfectly be placed on the can. After the can was done we made a little scene where we put camera in 
                right position for better rendered image and then started position the light. This task relates to LO5 because it significantly helps me in becoming a game designer whom I want to 
                become in the future, because I learn how to create 3d models, which I enjoy doing and which I can later on implement into games I will be macking.

                During one of the lectures we had to create Database App where we would add books name and its author after which they will be saved on localhost and will have their own ID.
                The ID is also used to delete the book from localhost. I followed the tutorial on how to make it and managed to succed without any problems. After I was done with the library itself I 
                asked for feedback from teacher and he said that I can style it so it looks better which I did. This assignment relates to LO2 because I managed to create a functional database and I also 
                commented the code as well as uploaded it on GitLab. The assignment also relates to LO3 because I recevied feedback on it and made second itteration where I made styling for the database.

                When Mid-Fidelity Prototype was done I made a User Testing with one of the students to see what can be improved on our Prototype. The feedback that I received from him I also 
                implemented later on the website. All of the feeedback was implemented from that student by me, here is what I added: added a button on the main page to indicate that the website 
                is scrollable, extended one of the waved on the main page so that the text isn't interrupted, changed About Us button, I also created a small branding for the Nutrition Plan. The brand 
                I made consists of the font that we agreed on as the group and the Logo, the design of which I took from our Team Logo that I made and reworked it according to the style of gradient waves 
                that we have in the Prototype to represent the website itself and us, as a team, who made the website. After that we later made one more testing together, as a group, with the teacher and got feedback 
                on it. From that teting I changed the color of the Start button to Gradient. This part of the Project relates to LO3, because when the testing was done I've made an improved version of the website That
                is based on the feedback we got. It also relates to LO4, because we used a method of User Testing our work to see what is missing in our Prototype and what we can improve. It also relates to LO1 
                because I've made a Brand Identity for our Nutrition Plan.

                When the design phase was finished it was time to implement the concepts we gathered. With the confirmation of my team members I assigned the tasks to each of us and as for 
                myself I had to make pages for all of the questions we had, which is 18, in total, the questions themselves are gathered both from what AI needs in order to create a good Nutrition 
                Plan, and from research that we made. For each question I made a page where in order to choose an answer you will have to select one of the options and then click next, or input 
                some information and then click next. The background are an animated waves that changes its gradient color to give a calming feeling for the user, which we discussed during design phase.

                During my Semester as you already know I had a big problem with my Git Lab and Fontys account in general that I couldn't resolve for quite a long time. The problem as I found 
                out later on was with my password and user name for GitLab, the information I was inputting as my login details wasn't correct both for User name and password, the Username I have to use 
                as I found out was @ and my fontys login numbers and the password is the one that I didn't know was still there. That's where I had another problem, I couldn't login to Canvas by tayping 
                password on my own but it as saved in google passwords and that was the only way I could have entered Canvas at that time. Later on I found out that the new password I created long time ago for 
                my Fontys account was not working for all of the Login details and I had another password for different logins and services. When that information was revealed for me I've tried to login 
                to both Canvas and GitLab with that old password and it worked for me. I also notified how I resolved in <a href="https://fhict.instructure.com/courses/13771/external_tools/1067">FeedPulse</a>.
                This issue and solution I found relates to LO2 because it's one of the major requirements to use GitLab specifically instead of GitHub that I was using previously. I would also relate that to LO5 because 
                it shows my desire to correct the mistake myself before asking for help from others, which is a good personal trait. Also, now you can find every file that was uploaded to GitHub on GitLab as well.

                After all of us were done with their task for Group Website it was time to make a Final Presentation for the Group Project. We splitted the tasks on who is doing what inside of
                the presentation and I was responsible for creating slides for Design part of our Project as well as presenting it. This part of the Project relates to LO5 because as mentioned earlier 
                I am not really good at presenting in front of a lot of people and this presentation helped me quite a bit to improve this skill since there were many teachers watching me explaining everything 
                from my part and I managed to not forget to say anything from what I have prepared to say during presentation and wasn't nervous as much as I were in previous presentations.

                for this time I still have started with sculpting it's main features of the face she will. It might not look too pretty just yet, but I really want to improve it in my future itterations 
                so in the end the result must look better then it is right now :) This part relates to LO5 because knowing how to make proper 3d models is a big part in whom I want to become in the future.

                definetly do that for the next itteration. I also said previously that I want to implement scrolling to the side, but as the teacher said during previous Portfolio talk they should be able to 
                read the entire Portfolio in 20 minutes which will be annoying to scroll to the side in order to find the exact inforamtion you are looking, so, I took into consideration the suggestion of 
                teacher to split my Portfolio into sections for easier navigation and review and I am going to leave the idea of side scroll for when I will want to showcase my work wjile applyng for the job.
                Also, I decided to not implement VHS effect to the TV because it might be irritative to read. Instead, I implemented a feature for easier reading session to turn off the background GIF when 
                pressed On/Off button. For the next itteration as I said I want to focus more on 3d and make the scene that will actually tell the atmosphere of the past that I had.

                After the Group Project was finished we had to make our own Personal Passion Project. For that I was looking for a stakeholder for quite a few days and then found one. It was 
                my friend who had a Stationery shop in Ukraine and was looking to create an online shop. With that, I agreed with her that I will make a design for her future website. Once 
                I found a stakeholder I began making the Concept Document for the Project. Inside of it, I separated it into multiple sections and in the beggining described who the client is and 
                what is my task inside of this Project. Once that was done I continued with the research that I made, both primary and secondary, where I made Survey, Interview, Persona and Competitive Analysis.
                After that I made a section where I showed prototypes that I made and explained how and why I made these and those choices for design and functionality parts. The document ends with 
                the conclusion where I stated, that after the talk with the client the Project was succesfully finished and the client was more than satisfied with it. This document relates to LO4, because 
                I applied a relevant methodological approach used in the professional field to formulate project goals, involved stakeholder, conducted applied research, and delivered a report. Here is the link

                As a part of a Primary research the first step was to make a Survey. I created one and spreaded it among 8 people. Inside of that Survey I asked some personal questions like age,
                gender. Those questions helped me later on create a Persona. After personal questions I asked the technical questions that will help me create an appropriate design which will include 
                user wants and needs, I also asked some questions on what kinds of stationery do people buy the most, in order to display them properly on the website. After I got enough results I contacted 
                client, and asked her what features does she want to see on the store and what kind of goods does her store sell. I noted everything down afterwards in the Concept Document. This part of Project
                relates to LO4, because I applied a relevant methodological approach in order to achieve the project goal. Here is the link to Survey: <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1aMEEezJqzt7iw1lzb7HDfxOzVedKIVrhuMusS92Hn1g/edit#responses">Passion Survey</a>

                as well as I asked questions about her experience with stationery stores, online and in real life and what is her opinion and suggestions on how to improve certain aspects 
                in those shops. Once the Interview was done I ranscripted it and put it into the Concept Document. This task relates to LO4, because I made an Interview which one of an essential

                After the Primary Research was completed I created a Persona from the information that I ateined from both Interview and Survey. The Persona was done to better understand the 
                Target Audience of such kind of shop and what are their needs, wants and frustrations. This Persona will also help my client to understand who are their major customers, and will help her 
                make her business more related to the target audience. This task relates to LO4, because creating Persona is one of the most important part in Research in order to achieve the Goal of 
                Project.

                The final step to conduct my Research was to create a Competitive Analysis. This was neccessary in order for me to understand how the sphere of Stationery web shops 
                works, what is the standard and what features or design techniques do they use. For that I found three staionery stores on the web, which are: <a href="https://www.musthavestore.nl/">MUSTHAVESTORE.nl</a>,
                <a href="https://www.vanbeekart.nl/">Vanbeekart.nl</a>, and <a href="https://pipoos.com/">Pipoos.com</a>. Each of the store had different designs, but somewhat the same functionalities,
                I described the key points I noticed that was helpful for me later on in creating my design in the Competitive Analysis Document. Essentially, the first example, the MUSTHAVESTORE was the one 
                that I tended to use as an inspiration for the design that I was making the most. This task relates to LO4, because I made a very important research where I compared the competitors 
                between each other to end up with the best possible design for my client. Here is the link to the Competitive Analysis: <a href="https://www.figma.com/design/In4d4fjXtBTeDVWNNqvcyu/Untitled?node-id=0-1&t=8l3UBoIYaA5Bq1UO-0">Competitive Analysis</a>

                When the Research was complete I notified client about it and immediately began making the Low-Fidelity Prototype. As was requested from the clent, and the users I decided to 
                stick with the simple and easy to navigate through layout. I decided to also not overwhelm users with the information like special offers and instead straight up made a page that 
                leaded to the products, with the a Hero on top, to claryfy that you are on the Stationery webshop. Every detail and choice that I made for a Layout of each page is explained in the Concept Document, link to it:

                This part of Project relates to LO1, because I created a prototype design choices of which I explained in the Concept Document. Here is the link to the design itself: <a href="https://www.figma.com/design/mu2xkYnJjRkxEw95oamkmq/Untitled?node-id=0-1&t=zhqVbhSmlOBzkMge-1">Low-Fidelity Passion Project Prototype</a>

            Once the Low-Fidelity version was done I started to make a Mid-Fidelity version of it to showcase how the website would look like. Once I was done with making the design I showed it to 
            my client and she very much liked it, she later on asked me add a few more things to it, a checkmarks for multiple choice of categories and she also asked me to make a Like page. Once I received the feedback I immediately changed it
            and added another Like page. Once it was done I added it to Concept Document with this ending my Passion Project. I was also planning to make a version where I connected and made more pages but I 
            had a very limited time and the final Goal to make a Prototype which will be available for future improvements and implementing into a website was accomplished, so, the Project was still 
            successful. All of the design choices I made for Mid-Fidelity version are also explaind in the Concept Document: <a href="https://stichtingfontys-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/personal/519553_student_fontys_nl/Documents/Passion-Concept-Document.docx?d=wd37d1407d3804b0fac9a0ab147b764a4&csf=1&web=1&e=Lo1C2h">Concept Document for Passion Project</a>.
            This task relates to LO1, because of an Prototype, design choices of which was explained, and LO3, because I made one version of it, asked for feedback from client, and made another version of it.

            As one of the most important part from previous itteration of my Portfolio I promised to finish the scene from main screen to represent myself. And I did. The doll was made,
            even though I didn't find free texture for it, I created my own by painting directly in the Blender. I also made the same for other objects in the scene, played with light to show 
            whaat kind of light I had back in the day, and putted a camera in the right position to take a picture. This task relates to LO5, because I take steps in order to improve my skills 
            and become 3d designer/game developer in the future.

            After the Third evaluation the teacher asked me to show more steps that  I am taking in order to become 3d artist in the future. Apart from improving my skills in that 
            one of my colleagues has suggested for me to look for the job opportunities. I took this into account and started looking for a job opportunities in the Netherlands. From what 
            I found out, is that a lot of companies expects you to know 3ds Max, or Maya as a main tool and they ask you to be able to create a High poligonal models as well. It is a good thing 
            to know that I also have to get around with other programms and don't stick to Blender only, also, from I read I should also practice more and more in order to be able o create High 
            Polygonal models. Overall, looking for the job opportunites was an interesting and useful experience which opened my eyes on how the sphere is working. This task that i did relates to 
            LO5, because in looking for job opportunities from the early stage I take steps from the very start that will gradually help me in becoming a proffessional 3d designer.

            On the last week, right before the final subbmission of the Portfolio we had an ending day to end the Semester in a good way. We ate pizzas (for free!) and watched movies 
            that the groups made last Semester. Overall, it was fun day and I enjoyed it gradually. I am reffering the attendance of this day to LO5, because from the previous assessments 
            teachers suggested that I visit such kinds of events because it is useful both for ourselves and for LO, so I took their advice into account and visited the last day, and I didn't 
            regret it all! (free pizza, after all:)). So, this meeting relates to LO5, because it shows that I am opened for suggestions and take them into account, which makes me a better person.

        <p class="p-proof">
            Overall, I think it was very productive Semester, in every field possible. Starting the semester I wasn't so confident in my coding skills, now I have improved gradually in it,
            learned a lot of new stuff, like web applications and databases, fixed my gitlab and overally improved in that sphere. I also improved in my design skills, the teacher also mentioned 
            it to me during one of the talks where he said that the structure of the designs that I make have significantly improved from what I had before. I also think so myself, I started to 
            see the patterns and proffessional standard layouts on the website, I know how to properly position things on the website for a convinient usage and I also learned how to create pleasing 
            designs as well. Also, not to forget that I finally decided what is going my choice for my future carrier, which is game related field of 3d designer/developer, and I already started investing 
            a lot of my time in it and taking steps in order to be prepared for this future and become the best specialsit in this field as I can. And last, but the least, I improved a lot as a person and 
            proffesional, I become much more opened to meet new people and get used to them, became more confident in presenting, learned how to deal with multi-cultural team, learned how to take 
            responsibility for leading the group and myself. So, in conclusion, I think it was a great Semester that improved me so much in every way possible, and, I think, I have managed to reach quite confident 
            proficient level in every Learning Outcome that we had. In the future, once I go to game design I want to improve my skills in 3d modelling field and find myslef a job in that field, because it is my 
            great passion to create models. As Henry Ford said "The best Job is well-paid Hobby." and I agree with, and that's why I want to find a work where I would be able to fullfill my passion and earn 
            money.
