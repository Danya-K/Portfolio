                In the first week I've created a Business Card for<br> myself. The design idea is taken from a movie<br> "American Psycho". I decided to make it in a<br> professional way because I love
                formal style and<br> thought it would be cool idea to make my Business<br> card that way. I also asked for feedback from<br> teachers and created two more iterations to relate<br> a little
                more to the movie. This assignment relates<br> to the 1 Outcome because I created a concept and<br> made design out of t using formal design principles<br> to show my professionalism 
                and using visual<br> design techniques creating a cube around to give a<br> 3d fealing and to focus all the attention on the<br> center text of the card. It relates to 3 Learning <br>Outcome
                because I've got feedback for it and made <br>two new versions  from it. This assignment also<br> relates to 5 Learning Outcome because it shows my<br> personal preferences in style. </p>

            <p class="p-proof-group-logo">
                After we finished the Contract Agreement it was<br> time for us to work on the branding for our Group.<br> We went through a lot of different iterations.<br> Those, that you see
                on the picture are all my<br> variants, the biggest one at the bottom is the one<br> that we agreed as a group to use it as our Final<br> Logo for the company. At first i was
                trying to<br> combine S's in the design that can remind of<br> something (snakes), that is why we also went for<br> the green at the beginning, because we were<br> expecting to go
                green theme for our company to look<br> nature-friendly, securing and growing. But, after I<br> asked for feedback from other students to see what<br> they think about it I 
                figured that snakes aren't<br> the best allegory for the company that creates<br> websites since it reminds of something poisonous,<br> betraying or something related to
                medicine. That is<br> when we wanted to make something different. We <br>agreed with the group to try new approach and<br> combine our interests into new design and concept.<br>
                We found out that we are very different group with<br> very different interests. That's why, since we are<br> internationals and have different interests I've<br> tried to 
                make a Logo with planet but it went not so<br> well and, in the end, after we got feedback from<br> teacher that it takes too long for us to create a<br> Logo we agreed to
                stay with spiral-looking circle<br> from S's I made previously. But, I decided to<br> improve on it. After getting feedback from the<br> teacher saying that I should try 
                to make it look<br> like an infinite stairs that doesn't have start and<br> end  I combined colours as well as their shades in<br> such manner that it looks like an infinite
                loop.<br> The 3 S's at the bottom of the Logo stands for our<br> group name "Triple-S" and is made in futuristic <br>style that was one of the things that was common<br> for us
                that we all liked. The purple shade was an<br> idea from another student from my group, Danylo, he<br> showed me list of colours and their psychological<br> meaning where
                we chose the one that suits our team<br> the best, which is purple, because it is futuristic <br>and ambitious, just like we are. Also, I need to<br> mention that first
                iterations of Logos were made in<br> Figma but, after receiving feedback that I need to<br> use Professional tools I made the last one<br> completely in Adobe Illustrator.
                This Assignment<br> relates to these Learning Outcomes: LO1, because<br> I've created a concept in Figma and translated it<br> into a complete finished product in Adobe<br>
                Illustrator applying visual design techniques and<br> principles as well as using examples from Infinite<br> Stairs; LO3, because I had around 15 iterations<br> with
                different approaches and feedback as I<br> explained higher; LO4, because I applied methods<br> for colours from professional fields of psychology<br> not only for
                purple colour, but also for the shades,<br> the deeper the S goes, the darker it becomes<br> creating an infinite loop bottom to top. Here is<br> the link to all of

                As one of the Branding part for our group we agreed that I am going to make a poster for the group. At first I made the one with abstract figures with cubes background.
                 The figures are made to give a 3d feeling and are made in futuristic shape and colour. I made front version as white and back version as black since we have two 
                 versions of our Logo for dark theme and for light theme. The first feedback I got from teachers was that it didn't represent our group and what we are doing. After I 
                 added the text of HTML,CSS and JavaScript I received feedback saying that the poster is quite boring. After that, I decided to go for completely new one and made front
                  page of the poster as a human statue with our Logo on him as well as our core values and what we are doing as a team. The SSS you see on his glasses as well as the 
                  Logo putted into his body is made by me in Photoshop. Texts are done in Illustrator. This assignment relates to this Learning Outcomes: LO1, because I've created a 
                  digital design using inspirations from other futuristic design ideas; LO3, because I had 3 iterations for the Poster where Poster was changing drastically from one

                After we created a low-fidelity Prototype for our group website and designated the layout and placement of objects on the website I created a mid-fidelity Prototype based on it.
                For the design choices I decided to stick to our group ideas to look futuristic and made the prototype in purple tones. I also kept up to website standards with fonts and made only 
                three main fonts for the entire prototype: one for Headlines, one for Navigation Bar and the last one for the Text Descriptions. On the main page I decided to put Poster I made because 
                it is a good way to represent futurism and our brand, in general. On the about us page I decided to make different font describing names to represent all of my colleagues individually.
                On the contact page I used AI to generate an image of a woman with a cup of tea to represent nice chatting wit our team. Here is the link to the AI service I used for it: DeepAI. This assignment 
                relates to LO1, because I created a design using using-centered design.

            <p class="p-proof">
                Once low-fidelity prototype was created it was time to create mid-fidelity prototype from it. For this stage I decided to stick to the low-fid design prototype and just visualise how it will look like 
                here. However, I added one more thing to it. I decided that I am going to make a scene on the main page myself as 3d models and put them on the main screen. This assignment relates to 
                LO1, for the same reason as for low-fidelity prototype, which is because keeping the design user-centered and is connected to my childhood. It also relates to LO5, because I decided to make 
                a 3d for it because I has 3d as one of my favourites hobbys and I would love to improve in it more and more and to become better in this sphere.

                When the design part was finished I started implementing the design I had in high-fidelity prototype (website). While creating I realised that I need to change a few things. 
                The first thing I changed was buttons, I moved the on and off button to the side because of the resolution of the picture of tv I had, as well as moved work and about buttons to 
                the center for more pleasing look. And, inside of work button I changed to only two links because I rememberd teacher told me once, that I shouldn't overwhelm navigation, so i decided 
                to simplify it. I also received feedback regarding the responsivness of the TV picture and how I can fix it by using "image border slicing", so, I did that and it made my website better looking. This assignment relates to LO1,
                because I simplified the website for better experience and changed positions of buttons for better exeprience as well. LO2, because it is a code that is uploaded on GitLab and is commented. LO3, because
                I received feedback on how to improve the responsivness and made it.

                Once we made Survey and spreaded it I decided to take a look at other Nutrition Plans on the web and tried to make a version for ourselves. The websites I used as an inspiration
                are: Website 1; Website 2. In general, I wanted to give website a look that will be suiting and easy to navigate through and interact for our target audience, which is middle-aged people. This 
                task relates to LO1, because I created a visual design concept for our website and used other websites as a standard. LO4, because I searched on the Internet for other simmilar websites to 
                create the best possible design. Here is the link to design itself:<a href="https://www.figma.com/file/Nv2aoMzsGZ2p8pHwbpCPJk/NUTRITION-PLAN-PROTOTYPE?type=design&mode=design&t=HNgYPHo6aHWAPG5x-1"> Project Low-Fid Prototype</a>.

                On our first lecture on Blender we were starting with Blender and was learning navigations and features by creating a 3d model of a house with bench, trash can and mail box.
                This task relates to LO1, because 3d is a significant part of design in general and knowing it can help you create unique and beatiful designs and concepts. It also relates to LO5,
                since as mentioned before I really love 3d and love to enhance my skills in it, this lecture helped me a lot to remind of how to navigate in Blender. Here is the link to GitHub of

                Once the research was finished and we had a Low-Fidelity version of our Prototype ready we started to create Mid-Fidelity version of it. Since I was the one to create a 
                Low-Fidelity version I was also the one responsible to create a Mid-Fidelity version. When making t I decided to stick with the design I made and made a functional and linked 
                Prototype. When creating the design I thought that it should be simple looking and easy to navigte through since our target audience are elderly people. Most of the functionalities I 
                added were taken from Research we made, ChatBot so that people will be able to ask questions regarding their Nutrition Plan, Workout Page, so that people who strive to become muscular
                can also know what workout to do. When I was done with the Prototype we meet with other team members and discussed how it is. When discussion was done we agreed the design looks to simple 
                and we should make something more interesting since it's one of the tasks from our client to experiment with it. Then we made a few other itterations for main page look and feel and 
                ended up choosing Danylos version of main page. Then we reassigned tasks on who will do which page and I was the one who made a design for Questions page and for the About page. This 
                assignment relates to Learning Outcome 1, because I created a concept of Low-Fidelity Prototype and translated it into an interactive Prototype using research we conducted. It also relates
                to LO3, because I made fully one Itteration and then also made another itteration for other design choice we made for Prototype.

                commented the code as well as uploaded it on GitLab. The assignment also relates to LO3 because I recevied feedback on it and made second itteration where I made styling for the database.

                When Mid-Fidelity Prototype was done I made a User Testing with one of the students to see what can be improved on our Prototype. The feedback that I received from him I also 
                implemented later on the website. All of the feeedback was implemented from that student by me, here is what I added: added a button on the main page to indicate that the website 
                is scrollable, extended one of the waved on the main page so that the text isn't interrupted, changed About Us button, I also created a small branding for the Nutrition Plan. The brand 
                I made consists of the font that we agreed on as the group and the Logo, the design of which I took from our Team Logo that I made and reworked it according to the style of gradient waves 
                that we have in the Prototype to represent the website itself and us, as a team, who made the website. After that we later made one more testing together, as a group, with the teacher and got feedback 
                on it. From that teting I changed the color of the Start button to Gradient. This part of the Project relates to LO3, because when the testing was done I've made an improved version of the website That
                is based on the feedback we got. It also relates to LO4, because we used a method of User Testing our work to see what is missing in our Prototype and what we can improve. It also relates to LO1 
                because I've made a Brand Identity for our Nutrition Plan.

                During one of the UCD lectures we had a task where we had to make the design for the shop that would be the most convinient for him to use and buy. I was making my shop based on 
                shop websites I visited the most, which is <a href="https://www.bol.com/nl/nl/?Referrer=ADVNLGOO002003-B5O4R2UTKLNHE-240857871042&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjwpZWzBhC0ARIsACvjWRMTWVUzZfgqTmeVCZrBk71twZW9x0G1H-4JRn1pxIgDVTJj7zfa2rMaAuV7EALw_wcB">Bol</a> and <a href="https://www.mediamarkt.nl/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=BR.+-+Branded+-+Algemeen&utm_term=mediamarkt&gclsrc=aw.ds&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjwpZWzBhC0ARIsACvjWROTPYdp0_j9dz5aaxzd2a8jhQPkhNkoxFUg2ShZNZQKm4sWxd3ueTgaArG-EALw_wcB">MediaMarkt</a>.
                This assignment relates to LO1, because I created a design concept of a shop that would encourage user to buy things from my shop based on the web-shops I know about.
