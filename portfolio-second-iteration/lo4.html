                We started our group work wit creating Contract<br> Agreement with our newly formed group. Except<br> creating Problem/Solution Section inside of the<br> Contract I was the one
                to create a template with<br> different shades of green on the objects and I also<br> made that temporary Logo to fit the template of the<br> Contract. The template is made in
                green and<br> professional style because we were expecting with<br> the group to go with that style as our main later<br> on. This task we made relates to 4 Learning Outcome <br>
                because we used professional standard for Contracts<br> in order to create our own Contract report. Link to<br> the Contract:<a href="https://www.figma.com/file/adh7Ssm9Xuxl7x5Onbm0Yk/Untitled?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=hXUg8BijLVJOdgbC-1">Contract Agreement</a>.

            <p class="p-proof-group-logo">
                After we finished the Contract Agreement it was<br> time for us to work on the branding for our Group.<br> We went through a lot of different iterations.<br> Those, that you see
                on the picture are all my<br> variants, the biggest one at the bottom is the one<br> that we agreed as a group to use it as our Final<br> Logo for the company. At first i was
                trying to<br> combine S's in the design that can remind of<br> something (snakes), that is why we also went for<br> the green at the beginning, because we were<br> expecting to go
                green theme for our company to look<br> nature-friendly, securing and growing. But, after I<br> asked for feedback from other students to see what<br> they think about it I 
                figured that snakes aren't<br> the best allegory for the company that creates<br> websites since it reminds of something poisonous,<br> betraying or something related to
                medicine. That is<br> when we wanted to make something different. We <br>agreed with the group to try new approach and<br> combine our interests into new design and concept.<br>
                We found out that we are very different group with<br> very different interests. That's why, since we are<br> internationals and have different interests I've<br> tried to 
                make a Logo with planet but it went not so<br> well and, in the end, after we got feedback from<br> teacher that it takes too long for us to create a<br> Logo we agreed to
                stay with spiral-looking circle<br> from S's I made previously. But, I decided to<br> improve on it. After getting feedback from the<br> teacher saying that I should try 
                to make it look<br> like an infinite stairs that doesn't have start and<br> end  I combined colours as well as their shades in<br> such manner that it looks like an infinite
                loop.<br> The 3 S's at the bottom of the Logo stands for our<br> group name "Triple-S" and is made in futuristic <br>style that was one of the things that was common<br> for us
                that we all liked. The purple shade was an<br> idea from another student from my group, Danylo, he<br> showed me list of colours and their psychological<br> meaning where
                we chose the one that suits our team<br> the best, which is purple, because it is futuristic <br>and ambitious, just like we are. Also, I need to<br> mention that first
                iterations of Logos were made in<br> Figma but, after receiving feedback that I need to<br> use Professional tools I made the last one<br> completely in Adobe Illustrator.
                This Assignment<br> relates to these Learning Outcomes: LO1, because<br> I've created a concept in Figma and translated it<br> into a complete finished product in Adobe<br>
                Illustrator applying visual design techniques and<br> principles as well as using examples from Infinite<br> Stairs; LO3, because I had around 15 iterations<br> with
                different approaches and feedback as I<br> explained higher; LO4, because I applied methods<br> for colours from professional fields of psychology<br> not only for
                purple colour, but also for the shades,<br> the deeper the S goes, the darker it becomes<br> creating an infinite loop bottom to top. Here is<br> the link to all of
                the designs:<a href="https://www.figma.com/file/QFHKV2YdPIVMbycFyI06aL/Contract-agreement-group-1-sem-3?type=design&node-id=384%3A100&mode=design&t=DEFydoUeCjZZ9uzr-1"> Logo Designs</a>.<br> Link to both Group Feedback and Personal Feedbacks I was receiving from teachers:<a href="https://fhict.instructure.com/courses/13771/external_tools/1067">Personal Feedback, Group Feedback</a>.

                After we were done with branding of our own team we had a Client Presentations for Project choice and, once, we choose a client we startedd making Concept Document. And we 
                began it with creating Survey. Inside of it I made 7 questions regarding functionality and content on our service we are going to provide. I spreaded the Survey among very few middle-aged 
                people I knew, because they are our Target Audience for the Project. We also received feedback on the Survey saying that we need to also ask about allergies of people as well as their gender and age which I implemented later on. 
                This task relates to LO3, because we got feedback and created second itteration from it. LO4, because in order to acieve our project goal we applied a methodological approach and 
                asked our potential users what they would like to on our product by making a research survey.Here is a link to the Survey:<a href="https://forms.gle/exVewCuaeNctbd9t5"> Survey</a>.

                Once we had a lecture about POV/HMW where we had to create a POV/HMW for the Brand Idea on Food. This assignment relates to LO4, because that is a research I made in order 
                to better understand how I can create a service where people would be able to get best quality food for cheapest prices and without spending money on it.

                One of the tasks inside Concept Document that I did was Customer Journey. Based on Persona provided by our client I created a possible way on how the user will end up 
                using our service and what path it will take for him/her to get to it. I also received feedback on it saying that I need to add up and downs to see what was negative experience 
                of the user, also, I should have extended it, which I did.This task relates to LO3 because I received feedback and changed it accordingly. This Assignment also relates to LO4, because it is an important ascpect of Concept Document report that shows
                our users path to find and use our service. Here is the link for Customer Journey:<a href="https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVKZ7XXj8=/?share_link_id=306604599013"> Customer Journey</a>.

                For the Concept Document we also created a Lotus Blossom Framework to generate some ideas on what we can implement in our product. I generated ideas for Services 
                section and User-Friendly Interface. This task relates to LO4, becuase, just like Customer Journey, it is an importnt part of Concept Document report tht helps us knowing 
                wht should be on our end product and what shouldn't be here.

                Huge part of our Project was to create a Concept Document. Inside of it I made Introduction Part, Customer Journey Part, Lotus Blossom Framework Part, Low-Fidelity Prototype (PC) Part,
                Future Itterations, Conclusion and Appendixes as well as helped others fixing small issues like styling in the document. Since it is a very big part of our Project we got 3 feedback on just 
                the Document itself, without including individual feedbacks we got on each part of the document. There were a lot of things to change and a lot of things have been changed, starting from 
                layout, positiong, look continueing with adding introductions for each part of document and ending with changing the description of each part of the document. This Document relates to 
                LO3, because we got a significant amounts of feedback and changed the document multiple times. LO4, because it is main research document report.

                When Mid-Fidelity Prototype was done I made a User Testing with one of the students to see what can be improved on our Prototype. The feedback that I received from him I also 
                implemented later on the website. All of the feeedback was implemented from that student by me, here is what I added: added a button on the main page to indicate that the website 
                is scrollable, extended one of the waved on the main page so that the text isn't interrupted, changed About Us button, I also created a small branding for the Nutrition Plan. The brand 
                I made consists of the font that we agreed on as the group and the Logo, the design of which I took from our Team Logo that I made and reworked it according to the style of gradient waves 
                that we have in the Prototype to represent the website itself and us, as a team, who made the website. After that we later made one more testing together, as a group, with the teacher and got feedback 
                on it. From that teting I changed the color of the Start button to Gradient. This part of the Project relates to LO3, because when the testing was done I've made an improved version of the website That
                is based on the feedback we got. It also relates to LO4, because we used a method of User Testing our work to see what is missing in our Prototype and what we can improve. It also relates to LO1 
                because I've made a Brand Identity for our Nutrition Plan.
