                In the first week I've created a Business Card for<br> myself. The design idea is taken from a movie<br> "American Psycho". I decided to make it in a<br> professional way because I love
                formal style and<br> thought it would be cool idea to make my Business<br> card that way. I also asked for feedback from<br> teachers and created two more iterations to relate<br> a little
                more to the movie. This assignment relates<br> to the 1 Outcome because I created a concept and<br> made design out of t using formal design principles<br> to show my professionalism 
                and using visual<br> design techniques creating a cube around to give a<br> 3d fealing and to focus all the attention on the<br> center text of the card. It relates to 3 Learning <br>Outcome
                because I've got feedback for it and made <br>two new versions  from it. This assignment also<br> relates to 5 Learning Outcome because it shows my<br> personal preferences in style. </p>

                Second Assignment in the first week was to create<br> two photos: one Professional looking and second one <br>Creative. For the Professional me and my team found<br> a spot outside
                 of university and made pictures with<br> the Dots background. For the Creative photo I<br> suggested to draw something on the desk with<br> markers and take a picture using the
                  drawing as a<br> background. I made a drawing with a nimb and wings<br> and I took an inspiration for that painting from <br>anime "Death Note", there was a scene where a <br>
                  character was standing with wings behind him which<br> I really liked. This assignment relates to 5 <br>Learning Outcome because it shows what I like in <br>the assignments I do.

                After the first week we had to create a<br> Presentation for the Group work we made. We made<br> our presentation based on the Paper Prototype Game<br> we made. Besides my
                involvement in creating slides<br> for the Presentation I was also the one who was<br> presenting in front of teachers and other students.<br> This task relates to Learning 
                Outcome 5 because<br> in my previous Semester I wrote that presenting is<br> my main weakness because it is really hard for<br> me to present in front of a lot of people since
                I<br> tend to forget words and feel embarrassed when a<br> whole lot of people watching me. Since then I was<br> trying to be the presenter for each presentation we<br> had in order
                to become better in that field. It was<br> a nice opportunity for me to improve since there<br> were 2 classes from 2nd and 3rd Semester which the<br> most of people I've ever
                presented to. Even though<br> there were some hesitations when I was presenting,<br> I still think it was great improvement because I<br> feel much more confident now in 
                presenting in front<br> of many people.

            <p class="p-proof">
                During one of the Lectures we had to split up in groups and create an idea for Brand. We got Food as our topic on brand. We started with brainstorming what and how we
                 can do it and then I've got an idea for creating an online shopping mall for shops. After we draw it and finalised I went in front of class to present for other 
                 students and teachers. Whilst I presented there was feedback regarding the idea I came up with. The idea was to make stores compete between each other since they 
                 would have the rating system for their products for customers to choose the best products from different shops, but, students noted that it would be unprofitable 
                 for stores to join and compete. Good note, the solution for it can be to start the app without big stores but smaller one, make them compete, make it so that people 
                 will start using our mobile app because of it comfortability for them, instead of going to the stores, saving a lot of time for them. Seeing all that big companies 
                 can risk of getting big competition from smaller stores once they start growing and, in doing so, our app will force bigger companies to join as well. This task 
                 relates to Learning Outcome 5, because I was presenting it in front of whole class and debating on the solution with students, which as I explained in previous 
                 assignment is a big achievement for me since I am not a fun of being a main attention of a crowd.

            <p class="p-proof">
                In my future iterrations I promised to create a website for my Portfolio. To start, I decided to create a low-fidelity Prototype to understand how it will look like with
                placements and design, in general. I decided to make my Portfolio website in old TV style because it is a big nostalgia for me when I was watching old cartoons on an old back 
                at home, so, I decided that it would be nice to make my Portfolio in that style since it is also a very appealing style to me. I also asked for feedback on it and received a 
                very positive feedback saying that it is a huge improvement from the one that I had in Previous Semester, also, for the mobile version I removed 3d part as stated in feedback as 
                well as for the back-up version decided to use Wix, web service that I used for first Portfolio itteration. This prototype relates to LO1, because I created a design that is connected to 
                my childhood and to me as a person, it also relates because I created it while keeping in mind that it should be easy to navigate and be able to go to the main content of website in a 
                few clicks. It also relates to LO3, because I asked for feedback about it and changed the Mobile version accordingly. And the last Ouctome it relates to is LO5, because for my personal growth 
                as a website developer and designer I created a website portfolio prototype with design that is in line with my core values. Here is the link to feedback I got:<a href="https://fhict.instructure.com/courses/13771/external_tools/1067"> Personal Low-Fid Portfolio Design</a>.

                Once low-fidelity prototype was created it was time to create mid-fidelity prototype from it. For this stage I decided to stick to the low-fid design prototype and just visualise how it will look like 
                here. However, I added one more thing to it. I decided that I am going to make a scene on the main page myself as 3d models and put them on the main screen. This assignment relates to 
                LO1, for the same reason as for low-fidelity prototype, which is because keeping the design user-centered and is connected to my childhood. It also relates to LO5, because I decided to make 
                a 3d for it because I has 3d as one of my favourites hobbys and I would love to improve in it more and more and to become better in this sphere.

                and together with colleague made a recording that later on I edited, cutted unnessecary parts and fails of recording. This assignment relates to LO5, because the assignment was optional
                but I wanted to know how those recordings are done in studios so I made a recording for it.

                On our first lecture on Blender we were starting with Blender and was learning navigations and features by creating a 3d model of a house with bench, trash can and mail box.
                This task relates to LO1, because 3d is a significant part of design in general and knowing it can help you create unique and beatiful designs and concepts. It also relates to LO5,
                since as mentioned before I really love 3d and love to enhance my skills in it, this lecture helped me a lot to remind of how to navigate in Blender. Here is the link to GitHub of

                As I said before, I would like to create a nice 3d for my website that would represent me and add more atmosphere to my Portfolio. Since I am going for old childhood vibe I 
                decided that it would be the most suiting to create a scene where you would be able to see the darkend room with old carpets on the wall, old table and toys that I used to have 
                and play when I was a kid. Since for now we had only one lecture on how to work with Blender modeling I created this scene only without any textures or colors, because I've never
                really worked with them. Once we have more lectures on it i am planning to improve it and add textures with colors and lights. I also want to sculpt a model of a doll that will be 
                sitting in the corner of the table but I will need a lecture on sculping for it, just like for the textures. This part of my Portfolio relates to LO5, because I am describing my plans 
                on how I want to finish this part and how I want to improve in the field of 3d. Here is also a link to GitHub file:<a href="https://github.com/Danya-K/Portfolio/tree/main/Week%209"> GitHub Blender Main Screen</a>.

                from bottom to the side and add filters with VHs effects to make TV more realistic. This relates to LO5, because I am stating what I want to make in fututre and how I want

                During one of lectures we were creating Coke can. We started by creating a can form using cylyndr and techniques we learned in previous lectures. After the shape was done we 
                began to put the texture on it and then correctly unwrapping it so it would perfectly be placed on the can. After the can was done we made a little scene where we put camera in 
                right position for better rendered image and then started position the light. This task relates to LO5 because it significantly helps me in becoming a game designer whom I want to 
                become in the future, because I learn how to create 3d models, which I enjoy doing and which I can later on implement into games I will be macking.

                During my Semester as you already know I had a big problem with my Git Lab and Fontys account in general that I couldn't resolve for quite a long time. The problem as I found 
                out later on was with my password and user name for GitLab, the information I was inputting as my login details wasn't correct both for User name and password, the Username I have to use 
                as I found out was @ and my fontys login numbers and the password is the one that I didn't know was still there. That's where I had another problem, I couldn't login to Canvas by tayping 
                password on my own but it as saved in google passwords and that was the only way I could have entered Canvas at that time. Later on I found out that the new password I created long time ago for 
                my Fontys account was not working for all of the Login details and I had another password for different logins and services. When that information was revealed for me I've tried to login 
                to both Canvas and GitLab with that old password and it worked for me. I also notified how I resolved in <a href="https://fhict.instructure.com/courses/13771/external_tools/1067">FeedPulse</a>.
                This issue and solution I found relates to LO2 because it's one of the major requirements to use GitLab specifically instead of GitHub that I was using previously. I would also relate that to LO5 because 
                it shows my desire to correct the mistake myself before asking for help from others, which is a good personal trait.Also, now you can find every file that was uploaded to GitHub on GitLab as well.

                I am not really good at presenting in front of a lot of people and this presentation helped me quite a bit to improve this skill since there were many teachers watching me explaining everything

                so in the end the result must look better then it is right now :) This part relates to LO5 because knowing how to make proper 3d models is a big part in whom I want to become in the future.

                As one of the most important tasks we had to create Portfolio Abstract where we would describe our Semester progress, how it went, what we (individually and in group) did and how.
                The document relates to LO4 because inside of it I describe the methods we used for the Research in our Group Project and it is also a report, which is also important. It also
                relates to LO5 because inside of it I describe who I am and whom do I want to become. Here is the link to the report: <a href="https://stichtingfontys-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/519553_student_fontys_nl/EUpU_J_2tmBBqwkU3MhOcoUB1XvdA_LnxXDE5gfAV_ARhQ?e=QV3LfP">Portfolio Abstract</a>

                From previous itteration I wanted to implement more of 3d into the main page, but, as I said before since we had lecture too recently I couldn't implement the full doll I wanted but I will 
                definetly do that for the next itteration. I also said previously that I want to implement scrolling to the side, but as the teacher said during previous Portfolio talk they should be able to 
                read the entire Portfolio in 20 minutes which will be annoying to scroll to the side in order to find the exact inforamtion you are looking, so, I took into consideration the suggestion of 
                teacher to split my Portfolio into sections for easier navigation and review and I am going to leave the idea of side scroll for when I will want to showcase my work wjile applyng for the job.
                Also, I decided to not implement VHS effect to the TV because it might be irritative to read. Instead, I implemented a feature for easier reading session to turn off the background GIF when 
                pressed On/Off button. For the next itteration as I said I want to focus more on 3d and make the scene that will actually tell the atmosphere of the past that I had.
