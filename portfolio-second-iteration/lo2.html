                During one of the lectures we had a task to generate a joke from the console on our Laptops using node.js. I've managed to complete it successfully. After I did so,
                 I uploaded it on Github (because my GitLab doesn't work). This assignment relates to the 2 Learning Outcome because I uploaded the code on GitHub and commented it.

                In order to track my work I am going to use GitHub. It is written in Canvas that I should use GitLab instead, but, for some reason it is not possible for me. When I am
                trying to Push to the branch the files I have it asks me to input my Log In details and when I do so, it says to me that the password is incorrect even though both 
                username and passwords are correct. I don't really know how to solve this problem because I can't even change my password since GitLab doesn't give me an option to do
                so. I hope it is fine that I am going to use GitHub, if I will be able to solve the problem with GitLab I will upload everything to it. Here is the link to GitHub:

                When the design part was finished I started implementing the design I had in high-fidelity prototype (website). While creating I realised that I need to change a few things. 
                The first thing I changed was buttons, I moved the on and off button to the side because of the resolution of the picture of tv I had, as well as moved work and about buttons to 
                the center for more pleasing look. And, inside of work button I changed to only two links because I rememberd teacher told me once, that I shouldn't overwhelm navigation, so i decided 
                to simplify it. I also received feedback regarding the responsivness of the TV picture and how I can fix it by using "image border slicing", so, I did that and it made my website better looking. This assignment relates to LO1,
                because I simplified the website for better experience and changed positions of buttons for better exeprience as well. LO2, because it is a code that is uploaded on GitLab and is commented. LO3, because
                I received feedback on how to improve the responsivness and made it.

                When the design phase was finished it was time to implement the concepts we gathered. With the confirmation of my team members I assigned the tasks to each of us and as for 
                myself I had to make pages for all of the questions we had, which is 18, in total, the questions themselves are gathered both from what AI needs in order to create a good Nutrition 
                Plan, and from research that we made. For each question I made a page where in order to choose an answer you will have to select one of the options and then click next, or input 
                some information and then click next. The background are an animated waves that changes its gradient color to give a calming feeling for the user, which we discussed during design phase.
                This part of the Project relates to LO2, because I managed to make a working Questions pages that are commented and are uploaded on GitLab. Here is the link to GitLab:

                During my Semester as you already know I had a big problem with my Git Lab and Fontys account in general that I couldn't resolve for quite a long time. The problem as I found 
                out later on was with my password and user name for GitLab, the information I was inputting as my login details wasn't correct both for User name and password, the Username I have to use 
                as I found out was @ and my fontys login numbers and the password is the one that I didn't know was still there. That's where I had another problem, I couldn't login to Canvas by tayping 
                password on my own but it as saved in google passwords and that was the only way I could have entered Canvas at that time. Later on I found out that the new password I created long time ago for 
                my Fontys account was not working for all of the Login details and I had another password for different logins and services. When that information was revealed for me I've tried to login 
                to both Canvas and GitLab with that old password and it worked for me. I also notified how I resolved in <a href="https://fhict.instructure.com/courses/13771/external_tools/1067">FeedPulse</a>.
                This issue and solution I found relates to LO2 because it's one of the major requirements to use GitLab specifically instead of GitHub that I was using previously. I would also relate that to LO5 because 
                it shows my desire to correct the mistake myself before asking for help from others, which is a good personal trait.Also, now you can find every file that was uploaded to GitHub on GitLab as well.

                Overall, I think it was very productive Semester, in every field possible. Starting the semester I wasn't so confident in my coding skills, now I have improved gradually in it,
                learned a lot of new stuff, like web applications and databases, fixed my gitlab and overally improved in that sphere. I also improved in my design skills, the teacher also mentioned 
                it to me during one of the talks where he said that the structure of the designs that I make have significantly improved from what I had before. I also think so myself, I started to 
                see the patterns and proffessional standard layouts on the website, I know how to properly position things on the website for a convinient usage and I also learned how to create pleasing 
                designs as well. Also, not to forget that I finally decided what is going my choice for my future carrier, which is game related field of 3d designer/developer, and I already started investing 
                a lot of my time in it and taking steps in order to be prepared for this future and become the best specialsit in this field as I can. And last, but the least, I improved a lot as a person and 
                proffesional, I become much more opened to meet new people and get used to them, became more confident in presenting, learned how to deal with multi-cultural team, learned how to take 
                responsibility for leading the group and myself. So, in conclusion, I think it was a great Semester that improved me so much in every way possible, and, I think, I have managed to reach quite confident 
                proficient level in every Learning Outcome that we had. In the future, once I go to game design I want to improve my skills in 3d modelling field and find myslef a job in that field, because it is my 
                great passion to create models. As Henry Ford said "The best Job is well-paid Hobby." and I agree with, and that's why I want to find a work where I would be able to fullfill my passion and earn 
                money.
